While uploading the recent [0.9 release][1] of Flycheck, I realized that Flycheck
has just had its half year anniversary.

Just half a year ago, at October 11th 2012, I published the first version of
what was to become Flycheck.  At this time however I still called it
“flymake-checkers”, and indeed it was just a tiny collection of some
[Flymake checkers][2] I had created for my personal use.

Now, just half a year later, it is a fully fledged, independent
[replacement for Flymake][3], with a considerable amount of
[built-in checkers][4], [many cool features][5], and [comprehensive
documentation][6].

This would not have been possible without [many helping hands][7], who added
reported bugs, gave feedback, contributed new syntax checkers or even new
features.  If you are a Flycheck user, be sure to give these awesome people some
Kudos.

I would like to thank all users and contributors of Flycheck for your continuing
help and support.  It is honor and fun to me to provide Flycheck to such awesome
people.
