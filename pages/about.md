I'm a student
=============

I'm currently doing my Computer Science Master at the
[Technische Universit채t M체nchen][TUM] (TUM), taking courses in computer
graphics, medical image processing, and software engineering (the usual patterns
stuff).  My majors however are programming languages and compiler construction,
and computer networks and security.

I'm a programmer
================

I came in touch with a lot of different programming languages, from C to Python
to OCaml and Haskell, and even Isabelle (a theorem proving language).  As an
Emacs user, I also know my share of (Emacs) Lisp, and Clojure.

I'm using OS X, Emacs, Zsh and Git for most of my daily work.  Occasionally I
also use VisualStudio to write programs on Windows (for work).  Feel free to
take a look at at my [dotfiles][] on Github.

I like literature and theater
=============================

I enjoy music and movies, and I like reading political, philosophical and
historical books, and classic literature.  I *love* going to the theater (the
old style, with real actors) and watching plays.  Chances are good to meet me at
the [M체nchner Kammerspiele][], my favorite theater.
