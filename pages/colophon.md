This website is generated by [Hakyll][], and automatically deployed to Github
Pages by [Travis CI][].  Its sources are available on [Github][].  The style and
design are powered by [Bootstrap][].

I use Emacs to write the posts, on a Macbook Air, or on an Arch Linux desktop.
Take a look at my [Emacs configuration][] or my [dotfiles][].
